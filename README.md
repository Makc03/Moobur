## Overview of App

- A bad "Uber" replica

## User Inputs

- The user will be prompted with an alert, asking to allow location
  1. If user selects "no", app will simply close
  2. If user selects "yes", app will continue 

- Once loaded, cities surrounding the Phoenix area and beyond will appear 
- Aside the city name is the distance from our location (hard set in Mesa)
- Once you select a location, another screen with the drivers will appear, aside them is their rating. 
- After selectng a driver, the random number generator (explained in 'Features') will run
- Nothing else actually happens, but you can use it as a roulette for if you get more than 31 on the RNG :)

## Features

- After selecting a driver, a random number generator will run between 1-35. 
The number generated will the the amount of time, in minutes, that it will take for the driver to arrive.
HOWEVER, if the number happen to be greater than 31, it will simply say "driver unavailable"
